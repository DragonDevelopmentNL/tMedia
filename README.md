## 🛠️ Let's Get This Party Started!

1. **Clone the Fun** 🎯
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tberichten.git
cd tberichten
```

2. **Set Up Your Database** 🗄️
```bash
mysql -u yourusername -p yourdatabase < database.sql
```

3. **Configure Your Space** ⚙️
   - Open `config/database.php`
   - Fill in your database details:
     ```php
     define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
     define('DB_USERNAME', 'your_username');
     define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_password');
     define('DB_NAME', 'your_database');
     ```

4. **Create Your Upload Space** 📁

mkdir uploads
chmod 777 uploads
```

```

## 🎯 What You'll Need

- PHP 7.4+ (The newer, the better!)
- MySQL 5.7+ (For storing all the fun stuff)
- A web server (Apache/Nginx - your choice!)
- A modern browser (No Internet Explorer, please! 😅)

## 🛡️ Safety First!

We take security seriously (but not too seriously!):
- Passwords are hashed (like a secret recipe!)
- SQL injection prevention (no sneaky hackers allowed!)
- XSS protection (keeping the bad stuff out!)
- Secure sessions (your data is safe with us!)
